Site that generates buttons that generate gifs!

This assignment was actually fairly easy, we had done alot of what was required in individual assignments. We really just needed to put it all together for this one. The hardest thing for me was getting the gifs to populate the page how i wanted. You see once I added ratings they appeared one atop the another. So i had to play around with inline display properties. I still need to add a feature so you can't repeat buttons that already exist.
